/* Yes, the code is wrong because tne int is setup on 10 and the loop i is starting less than 5.
So the compare point which is 5 is greater than the initial point and it won't start, the correct answer is below*/
int i = 1;

/* It does now counts until i is less than 20 and then print each loop i.*/
